<h1> The Platforming Genre </h1>
<p> I have a lot of hobbies that I like to do during my free time but the one hobby that stayed with me since the beginning was playing video games.  I've been playing them since I was probably 3 years old and played a lot of different
 genres of it.  However the one genre that resonated with me early on was <strong>platformers</strong>.  Examples of platformers include <strong>Super Mario Bros, Sonic The Hedgehog, Crash Bandicoot, Mega Man </strong>etc.  Some can be 2D or 3D, with objectives that are 
 simple such as beating a level, or more complex where you would have to navigate through a maze to get to the goal.  The platforming genre was certainly a popular genre back in the day, and although they are not as common today, the 
audience for them is still out there.  My personal favorite platformer is <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy_2>Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>. </p>
